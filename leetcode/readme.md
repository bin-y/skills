leetcode
=============

I really hate this!
-------

I have no interest in this s**t, just doing this for the interview to get a job.

I'm more good at engineering and there are a lot of engineering ideas, that is more interesting and meaningful, waiting for take my time.

I prefer algorithm engineer and software engineer work divided on their own job like the way happened in crypto area.

Please stop asking about algorithm ideas, it is like asking a brainteaser for a software engineer who is not pre-prepaired/job-related on this.
