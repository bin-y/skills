leetcode
=============

~~I really hate this!~~ This is good
-------

~~I have no interest in this s**t, just doing this for the interview to get a job.~~

I did some exercise on this and I find it helps on improving my programming skill, but

I'm more good at engineering and there are a lot of engineering ideas, that is more interesting and meaningful, waiting for take my time.

I prefer algorithm engineer and software engineer work divided on their own job like the way happened in crypto area.

~~Please stop~~ asking about algorithm ideas ~~, it~~ is like asking a brainteaser for a software engineer who is not pre-prepaired/job-related on this.
